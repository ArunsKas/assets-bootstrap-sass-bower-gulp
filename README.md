# Assets for Bootstrap SASS with Bower & Gulp

> My SASS assets for a new project using Bootstrap, Bower & Gulp

### Techs used
This boilerplate uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

  * NodeJs
  * Bower
  * Gulp
  * Bootstrap
  * jQuery
  * SASS

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

#### First, get the git repository

In order to start a project with `Bootstrap SASS` & `jQuery`, first you'll better git the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zakaziko99/assets-bootstrap-sass-bower-gulp.git
cd assets-bootstrap-sass-bower-gulp/
```

<!-- #### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With `Node.js` installed & `composer.phar` on the local root, run the following one liner from the root of your '**MB**' application:

```sh
php composer.phar install
npm install -g bower gulp jshint jscs
bower install && npm install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The '**MB**' Symfony2 application requires the following major dependencies:

- Composer, a Dependency Manager for PHP modules.
- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have `composer.phar` file on your local root, please follow instructions on this page [Download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)

3)  If you don't have `Node.js` installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

4)  Install `bower`, `gulp`, `jshint` and `jscs` globally.

```sh
npm install -g bower gulp jshint jscs
```

This lets you run `bower` and `gulp` from the command line. (the working directory must be the root of your '**MB**' application)

The `jshint` and `jscs` modules to help to write better & clean JavaScript code (better install them globally)

5)  Install the '**MB**' application's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
bower install && npm install
```

This installs Automate Tasks for better workflow.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch (for Development)

Run the dev gulp task

```sh
gulp serve:frontsite
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Build & Vulcanize for distribution

```sh
gulp dist
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

#### Serve for testing the distribution files

```sh
gulp serve:dist
```
